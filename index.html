    <p>
      This is the repository for the NetBox community Helm charts, version 5.0 and up.
      It hosts the indexes that define the versions and resources needed to install NetBox inside a Kubernetes cluster.

      The indexes are auto-generated and are not meant to be human-readable, but you can find the current helm chart index <a href="index.yaml">here</a>.
